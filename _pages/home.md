As a machine learning engineer, I'm interested in projects that utilize natural language processing and computer vision.
I enjoy tasks involving document processing and understanding using text generative models and multimodal
models, retrieval-augmented generation, question-answering, and fine-grained image classification.

Previously, I completed a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh in 2021. My dissertation, under the supervision of
[Ajitha Rajan](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/arajan/) and [Javier Alfaro](https://www.proteogenomics.ca/), focused on
the interpretability of biological
sequences using natural language processing techniques. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science 
at San Diego State University in 2019.
